# ü§ñ Mirrobot Discord Bot [![License](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/C0C0UZS4P)

Mirrobot is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) bot that scans images for text patterns and provides automatic responses to common issues. The bot is designed to help server administrators manage technical support channels by automatically analyzing screenshots.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced OCR Processing**: Analyzes images posted in designated channels
- **Parallel Processing**: Configurable multi-worker system for handling OCR tasks simultaneously
- **Smart Queue Management**: Efficient handling of incoming images with backpressure control
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common issues from error messages
- **Automatic Responses**: Provides helpful solutions for recognized problems
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize command prefix and permissions
- **Role-based Permissions**: Grant specific access to commands by role or user
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Monitor OCR performance and queue metrics
- **Environment Variable Support**: Secure configuration through environment variables

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - Windows: Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
   - Mac: `brew install tesseract`
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mirrowel/Mirrobot-py.git`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create a config file:
   - Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json`
   - Add your Discord bot token and configure settings
   - Alternatively, use environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env`
6. Download appropriate tessdata language files:
   - Tesseract comes with "fast" data by default (fastest but least accurate)
   - For better results, download either:
     - **Regular**: Good balance between speed and accuracy
     - **Best**: Highest accuracy, but 2x slower than regular with only small accuracy gains
   - Get additional language data from [tessdata repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata)
7. Run the bot: `python main.py`

## üìö Dependencies

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bot can be configured in two ways:

### 1. Configuration File
The bot uses a `config.json` file to store:
- Discord bot token
- Command prefix (default: `!`)
- Designated channels for OCR reading and responses
- OCR worker count (default: 2)
- OCR queue size (default: 100)
- Command permissions

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "token": "your_discord_bot_token_here",
  "command_prefix": "!",
  "ocr_worker_count": 2,
  "ocr_max_queue_size": 100,
  "ocr_read_channels": {},
  "ocr_response_channels": {},
  "ocr_response_fallback": {},
  "server_prefixes": {},
  "command_permissions": {}
}
```

### 2. Environment Variables
For improved security, you can use environment variables:
1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Add your Discord bot token: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here`

Environment variables take precedence over the config file settings.

### Permission Management

The bot features a comprehensive permission system:

- Role and user-based permissions for commands and command categories
- Permission blacklists to prevent specific roles or users from using commands
- Persistent storage of permission settings that survive bot restarts

For details, see the [Permissions Documentation](docs/commands/permissions.md).

## üîê Permission System

Mirrobot uses a tiered permission system:

1. **Bot Owner** - Has unlimited access to all commands on all servers
2. **Server Administrators** - Have access to all commands on their server
3. **Blacklist** - Prevents command access regardless of other permissions (except administrators)
4. **Bot Managers** - Roles or users granted access to all non-system commands
5. **Category Permissions** - Roles or users granted access to all commands in a specific category
6. **Command-specific Permissions** - Roles or users granted access to specific commands

## üîç OCR Processing

Mirrobot automatically processes images posted in designated OCR read channels:

1. When an image is posted, it's validated for format and size requirements
2. Valid images are queued for processing with smart backpressure handling
3. Multiple OCR workers process the queue in parallel for better performance
4. The text is extracted using Tesseract OCR and analyzed for known patterns
5. If a pattern is matched, the bot provides an appropriate response
6. Responses are posted either in the same channel or in designated response channels

## üìä Stats and Monitoring

The bot tracks various statistics:
- Number of images processed
- Success/failure rate of OCR operations
- Queue statistics (current size, total enqueued, rejected, high watermark)
- Pattern match frequency
- Processing times and averages

View statistics with the `!status` command.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond to commands**: Check if the prefix has been changed. Use `@Mirrobot help` to check.
- **OCR isn't working properly**: Make sure Tesseract is installed correctly and the path is set in environment variables.
- **Permission errors**: Check server_info to verify permissions are set correctly.
- **OCR processing is slow**: Consider increasing the `ocr_worker_count` in the config file for better performance.
- **Queue filling up**: If the `!status` command shows the queue is frequently near capacity, increase the `ocr_max_queue_size`.
- **Log files**: Check the bot_YYYY-MM-DD.log files in the logs directory for detailed error information.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The bot includes robust error handling to maintain stability:
- Connection issues are automatically retried
- Queue backpressure prevents memory overload
- Config validation ensures proper setup
- Error logs are maintained in daily log files
- Critical errors are reported to the console

## üìö Additional Information

- Images must be less than 500KB and at least 300x200 pixels for OCR processing
- The bot can also process images from URLs in messages
- Custom pattern recognition can be extended in the source code
- Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory
